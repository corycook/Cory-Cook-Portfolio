Projects
--------

We have a collection of projects for any members of the club to participate in. 
These are great opportunities to build skills, build your resume, and learn more 
about computer science and engineering. The current projects are:

* [Colorsort Robot](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/csusb-cse-colorsort-team): 
  This is a project to develop a robot that uses visual image processing to sort a 
  collection of blocks by color.
* [Quadrotor Drone](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/csusb-quadrotor-project): 
  This is a project to build a quadrotor that can ascend high into the sky and identify 
  human forms.
* [Department of Defense Robotics Challenge](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/csusb-robotics-challenge): 
  This is a long-term project from the <abbr title="Department of Defense">DOD</abbr> 
  to develop a disaster-response robot that can handle tools, interact with humans, 
  and navigate the difficult post-disaster environments.
* [<abbr title="Computer Science and Engineering">CSE</abbr> Club Website Development](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cse-club-website-project): 
  This is a project to develop a brand new website for the <abbr title="Computer 
  Science and Engineering">CSE</abbr> Club. The website will be the central club 
  hub and will feature things like: book checkout, membership management, events, and projects.
